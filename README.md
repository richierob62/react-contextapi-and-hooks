## Context API & Hooks...

### Step 1

This is a setup that uses the Context API with a few hooks to
keep global state whilst using hooks.

Other asynchronous actions are handled as promises in actions.

I'm missing the SSOT paradigm of REDUX (each Context stands alone)... Feel free to share any ideas you have.

### Step 2
